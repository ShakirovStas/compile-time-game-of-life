compile-time-game-of-life
=========================

True GoL using only metaprogramming in C++11

Usage:
- edit 'dimension', 'iteration' and 'start' constants appropriately
- compile
- if your compiler was able to do it - you'll get the fastest implementatation of GoL available :)

TODO:
- printing all the iterations and not only the result
